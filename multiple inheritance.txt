1)Why java does notÂ support Multiple inheritance? 
Is there any way to do that. In java, every class is a child of Object class.
 When it inherits from more than one super class, sub class gets the ambiguity to acquire the property of Object class.
To avoid it we can use interface classes and with implements keyword.
