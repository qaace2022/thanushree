ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS _(15-02-2022)

1.When to go for double ? And When to use Float ?
 double datatype should be used for high accuracy of decimal value .for eg 44.44444987465 .
float will be using at the time when javac always takes value as default double datatype  so float is not recongised,error will occur . 
as possible lossy conversion from double to float,so we have to declare the value with f (either upper or lowercase). for eg 3.78f.
 
2.Can char store negative numbers in JAVA?
Negative numbers cannot be assigned to char, as char is an unsigned data type. 

3.  find the output 
           int a=10;int b=10; system.out.println(a++ + ++a);
Answer = 22 because a is incremental value so its incremented once from 10 to 11 then its cancadenated to ++a 
as this incremental function remains same ++a also 11 so by adding a++ and ++a _ 11+11=22

4. find the output 
int b = -10; System .out.println(~b);
Answer= 9 
it is unary operator and it gives positive of total negative

5. explore about short circuiting
 If evaluation of a logical expression exits in between before complete evaluation, then it is known as Short-circuit. 
A short circuit happens because the result is clear even before the complete evaluation of the expression, and the result is returned.

task -1
convert a do while loop to while loop 
answer:
int i=1;
 while(i<6) 
 { 
 System.out.println("I will get printed once for sure");            
i++;        
}

task-2
limitations of for each loop.
*Cannot retrieve elements based on an index
*It is not possible to traverse in reverse order
*Cannot modify array element values
